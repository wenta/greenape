**POC of Infinite monkey theorem**

From wikipedia:
*The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. However, the probability that monkeys filling the observable universe would type a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero).*

see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem

Goal of this project is to show that if we give monkey a keyboard it could write every possible function in finite time.
